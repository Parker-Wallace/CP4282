# Practice Exercise 1: A simple weather display

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## assignment and purpose

this exercise serves as an introduction to creat-react-app and making small components which interact with eachother.

the goal of the exercise is to loop through information in [StJohnsWeather.json](src/StJohnsWeather.json) and display the days of the week as headers followed by the weather information of each day in list format

the scond goal is to utilize *state changing* to instead pull the data from [OttowaWeather.json](src/OttawaWeather.json) on a button press, and to switch back when it is pressed again
