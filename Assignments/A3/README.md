# CP4282 Assignment #3 Due Friday June 21st ( 25 marks total )

For this assignment you will modify your solution to assignment #2 to include navigation and an
additional page where you can modify the data for your top 3 list.

can navigate between the top3 list and a page where you can edit the data:

Requirements:

#2 solution. Ensure that the repository is private. You can make it public after I have finished
marking.

3. (5 marks) Setup a basic naviation with two pages. One page for the top 3 display and one for
editing the list. Note, you may want to test the navigation by running in the browser as at this
point you won’t have navigation buttons. You will want to create a layout route which uses the
‘Slot’ component. https://docs.expo.dev/router/layouts/
4. (5 marks) Setup the React Context API to share data between both pages. This was demoed in
